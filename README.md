# Data-Mining-Logistic-Regression-and-Kernel-Regression
The first part of the code is used to implement the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for logistic regression,
given a training set and a testing set. 

The second part of the code is used to implement kernel regression using linear, quadratic (homogeneous), or gaussian kernels.
